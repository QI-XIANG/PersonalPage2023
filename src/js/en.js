    "about_content": "Unlike most other students who major in information management have had coding experience for a long time before university. I learn how to code in my first year of the fundamental programming design course and develop my interest and passion for programming gradually. Recap my life in university, sometimes I learn new tools to finish coding rapidly, and sometimes I acquire new skills while seeing something interesting. For example, with the hope of recording the programming history, I grasp how to use Git to do version control and take GitHub as the remote repository. During the process of learning, I have gained a lot and want to share the gains with others, so I finish my first e-Note about the basis of Git.<br><br>Nowadays, I think everyone in the world can be a pusher in the development of cyber society. Along with Information and technology moving forward every second, there are more and more unknowns waiting for us to explore. It makes me think working in the IT field is full of challenges. In the future, I hope I can keep my passion for mastering new skills and take courage to face various challenges.<br><br>Only hard work can make one look effortless.",
